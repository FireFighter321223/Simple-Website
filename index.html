Before the internet, bullying was a problem—but it was a problem that didn’t extend into the pockets,
 bedrooms, living rooms, and beyond of students’ lives. Parents, educators, 
 and mental health professionals in our communities are aware of how damaging cyberbullying can be
 but preventing it can be a major challenge.
The good news? We can take effective steps to keep students safe. 
Preventing the problem involves understanding just what cyberbullying is, 
 how big the problem has gotten, and examples of cyberbullying in action.
 <p>
       <h2>What is Cyberbullying?</h2>
        <body>
		Cyberbullying is a form of bullying that takes place over digital mediums. =
		Students may be cyberbullied on their phones, computers, 
		and other devices by receiving harassing chats, texts, messages, comments, forum posts, 
		and pictures that cause them emotional harm.
   
        <h2>Cyberbullying Facts</h2>
   <ul>
	<li>Often takes many forms (social media, texting, instant messaging)
    <li>Can be public or private</li>
    <li>Few parents and educators see cyberbullying in action</li>
    <li>Cyberbullies may act alone or in groups</li>
    <li>Cyberbullies may act anonymously (Victim never knows who exactly is targeting them.</li>
    <li>Because it’s online, cyberbullies can follow their victims wherever they go</li>
	</ul>
	<body>
	Instead of only tormenting their victims when they are in the same physical space,
	cyberbullies infiltrate their victims’ lives as often as they want to, sometimes even 24/7. 
	It can be difficult for victims to avoid communications and escape from their attacker. 
	Worse, false or hurtful information, private images, and other communications are recorded permanently online,
	and could affect the victim’s reputation for years to come. <a href="http:s//www.google.com">For more cyberbullying statistics click here.</a> 	
	
	  <h2>How can cyberbullying negatively impact students?</h2>
	  <body>
	  <li>Cyberbullying can cause a decline in academic performance, increase in school dropouts, physical violence and suicide.
	 “Suicide is the most severe consequence of cyberbullying, but there are many other symptoms that can result when a person is the victim of cyberbullying,
	  ” said Claire K. Hall, higher education attorney and Principal of UECAT Compliance Solutions. 
	  “Victims are at greater risk for depression. They are also more likely to abuse alcohol and other drugs. 
	  Therefore, it is critical that college students understand that they do not have to handle cyberbullying alone,
	  and that there are so many people on their campus who can help them, if they just reach out.”</li>
	  
	  <h1>TYPES OF CYBERBULLYING</h1>
	  <li><b>Flaming</b></li>
A confrontation often happening on message boards or other public online spaces, this usually entails one or more bullies attacking a particular person for their views or comments. The abuse can include harsh images, cruel language and even threats.
<li><b>Exclusion</b></li>
This is a singling-out of the targeted person. They are purposefully excluded from chats or ignored on message boards, but to add insult to injury, those who are ignoring that person will often send nasty comments to them or otherwise harass them.
<li><b>Harassment</b></li>
This happens when a bully or bullies repeatedly attack one particular person. The harassment might be done in one online space, such as a message board, or it might spill over to other areas, such as text messaging and various social media.
<li><b>Cyberstalking</b></li>
This is a type of harassment that involves one or more bullies going to great lengths to gather information about a particular person, continually frightening or threatening them, following them around social media and other sites, and potentially crossing the line into physical stalking and opportunity for physical harm.
<li><b>Outing</b></li>
This is the malicious release of personal and private information about a person, usually with the intent to embarrass or humiliate. The outing might take the form of pictures, videos or screenshots, or it could be spiteful rumors about someone's personal life, sexuality or other private information.
<li><b>Masquerading</b></li>
This happens when a bully creates a fake identity to harass someone anonymously or to impersonate someone else, often called “fraping,” such as pretending to be the victim or a significant other. The bully might also sign up on various social media sites and masquerade as the victim, creating a negative reputation for the victim. “Even if the cyberbullying is anonymous, students should still report the cyberbullying to a trusted administrator at their college or university,” Hall said. “Reporting it to a resident assistant, faculty member, advisor, or better yet, campus security is a really good idea.”
<li><b>Trolling</b></li>
Trolls try to provoke victims through the use of insults, controversial topics or off-topic posts into acting out in a similarly angry way. The provocation includes personal attacks on the victim.
<li><b>Catfishing</b></li>
This refers specifically to those cyberbullies who steal photos and information from a victim's social media account and recreate a fake one of their own, mimicking and pretending to be the victim. This can be especially damaging to college students, who might be befriended by or researched by current or future employers online.
 
    <h2>What to Do if You're Being Cyberbullied</h2>
	<body>
	“The students need to see the colleges and universities take action to stop cyberbullying when it is occurring,” Hall said. “If students know that the school takes it seriously, that it has policies and procedures designed to prevent the behavior, the students will be more likely to report cyberbullying when they see it or when it is happening to them.”

    <h2>If Someone You know is being BULLIED</h2>
	<body>
	Most effects of cyberbullying are noticed by those who are not the target. Friends and family might notice the problem when cruel posts begin to appear on social media or observe their loved one becoming withdrawn and nervous when they receive a text or email. Sometimes the bullying is obvious to those who are on message boards and the like, as they will see it happening right before their eyes. Here's what to do when it happens:
	<p>
	 <b>Be there</b><p>
     Those who are being cyberbullied often feel hunted or unsure of themselves. Talking to them, inviting them to spend time together and otherwise being a friend can help them feel better about the situation.
<p>
<b>Step up</b><p>
Tell someone about the cyberbullying. Talk to the friend about why they should not keep quiet about it.
<p>
<b>Never bully anyone</b><p>
Never jump into the fray when someone is being bullied; this makes you no better than the rest of them and may be harder to take seriously if things escalate.
<p>
<b>Stand up</b><p>
Tell the abuser that what they are doing is not okay. Make it perfectly clear, in no uncertain terms. Sometimes being called out on their activity will be enough to make them stop.
